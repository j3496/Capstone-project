	<p>You decide to ignore the shrubber, for no one in their right mind would buy or sell shrubberies</p>
	<p>As you approach the crowd you notice that everyone's talking to a man standing on a wooden stage, he is asking
		the crowd questions about wood and ducks</p>
	<p>Do you still want to go get a closer look at what they're talking about or would you rather go buy a shrubbery,
		for that seems much safer then what is happening here.</p>
