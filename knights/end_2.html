		siting juts outside it and a box siting on a tree stump just to your left</p>
	<button onclick="box()">Investigate the box</button>
	<button onclick="bunny()">Try to pet the bunny</button>

		function bunny() {
			document.write("You walk up to the bunny, and as you put out your hand to pet it, it jumps up and rips out your throat, The End")

			document.write("You walk over to the box and open it, inside is the most holy looking grenade you've ever seen, as you go to pick it up, you die because you're not the one, The End")
